		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>My dad's <em>sister</em> gave me this recipe for killer peanut butter cookies made with shortening.</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>½ cup shortening</li>
			<li>½ cup crunchy peanut butter</li>
			<li>½ cup white sugar</li>
			<li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
			<li>1 large egg</li>
			<li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</li>
			<li>¾ teaspoon baking soda</li>
			<li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
			<li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Cream shortening, peanut butter, and both sugars in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and
				fluffy. Beat in egg until incorporated. Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a separate
				bowl; gradually stir into peanut butter mixture until combined. Cover and refrigerate dough for at least
				1 hour.
			</li>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
			<li>Roll chilled dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto baking sheets. Flatten dough
				balls with a fork dipped in flour to form a crosswise pattern.
			</li>
			<li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to
				cool completely.
			</li>
		</ol>
